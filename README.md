# Checkout
### If you're logged into your account then your shipping info will show up, if you're not then you'll need to manually put that info in. You can also pay by card or PayPal.

# PayPal Purchase
### I created two PayPal accounts, one for a customer and one to act as the merchant in order to recreate what an actual purchase would look like through PayPal.
